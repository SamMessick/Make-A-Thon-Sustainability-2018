4 suitemates from room 401 Sullivan Hall got together to build
a solution to a sustainability problem on
campus with one day's time permitted. One of us, 
Cord Anthony, came up with the idea to create 
an automatic light switch that would count
how many people enter and leave a room and turn
the lights on/off accordingly.

Together with our different areas of expertise -- some gained over
the Make-A-Thon -- others gained through personal experience:
* Sam Messick: Embedded Systems and Electrical Engineering
* Will Carpenter: Networking and Database Management
* Cord Anthony: Autodesk 3D Fusion design and R statistical analysis
* Riley Stephenson: Statistical Analysis and Feasibility Presentation

we successfully create a functioning prototype of an automatic light
switch and pitched/demonstrated it before a panel of judges. Our prototype
consisted of an Arduino UNO with a Sparkfun WiFi shield tied into a 5V relay.
Although we did not win any tangible prizes from the event, we received an excellent
interdisciplinary working experience, positive feedback from staff in University
Housing and Facilities and enjoyed the satisfaction of
creating a tool to increase sustainability at our university.

Over the course of our project, our main goals were to have our device be:
* able to expand its use to other applications easily (HVAC regulation)
* able to integrate with little to no need for future physical infrastructure
* responsive to anybody, as long as they have a heat signature
* wirelessly responsive, so as to minimize the need for hardware updates
* minimally complex, so as to minimize malfunctioning and ease maintenance

We hope that our device may be adopted some day or expanded to more
general applications so as to benefit society.
